# Performance Optimization Progress

## 1. Request-Scoped Pattern Match Caching

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/types/diagnostics.ts` - Added support for request-scoped caches in `DiagnosticsInfo`
- `/src/utils/requestScopedCache.ts` - Created new utility module for request-scoped caching
- `/src/utils/pathUtils.ts` - Added caching to path pattern matching functions:
  - Updated `findMatchingPathPattern` to accept context and use cache
  - Updated `matchPathWithCaptures` to use request context for caching
  - Updated `extractVideoId` to pass context to called functions

**Implementation Notes:**
- Added request-scoped cache for path pattern matching, which should significantly improve performance when the same URL is matched against patterns multiple times during a request.
- Used the diagnostics object in request context to store caches, avoiding the need to modify existing context interfaces.
- Implemented straightforward cache key generation based on path and pattern count.
- Ensured cache hits and misses both update the cache for consistent behavior.
- Created specialized caching for different pattern matching functions.

**Type Checking:** ✅ Passed

**Testing:** 
Typecheck passed with no errors. The implementation maintains the existing API while adding optional context parameters, ensuring backward compatibility with all existing code.

## 2. Static Imports for Hot Path Functions

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/handlers/videoHandler.ts` - Replaced dynamic imports with static imports
  - Added static imports for request context functions and cache-related modules
  - Removed dynamic import calls that were slowing down the hot path
- `/src/index.ts` - Replaced dynamic imports in the main entry point
  - Statically import core modules and services 
  - Avoid redundant dynamic imports for frequently used functionality

**Implementation Notes:**
- Identified and replaced key dynamic imports in the hot path with static imports
- Focused on modules that are used frequently, such as:
  - RequestContext functions (addBreadcrumb, startTimedOperation, etc.)
  - Configuration-related modules (VideoConfigurationManager, ConfigurationService)
  - Cache-related modules (getCachedResponse, getFromKVCache, etc.)
- Maintained dynamic imports only where needed to avoid circular dependencies

**Type Checking:** ✅ Passed

## 3. Conditional Logging with Level Checks

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/utils/loggerUtils.ts` - Added level check functionality
  - Implemented `isLevelEnabled` function to check if a log level is enabled
  - Modified debug logging to check level before creating expensive objects
- `/src/utils/pinoLogger.ts` - Enhanced with level-based checks
  - Added `isLevelEnabled` function to check against configured log level
  - Modified all log functions to check level before any processing
  - Implemented early returns to avoid unnecessary object creation

**Implementation Notes:**
- Added level checking before expensive logging operations
- Ensured all log functions check if their level is enabled before creating objects
- Implemented a numeric level comparison for efficient checks
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing logging patterns

**Type Checking:** ✅ Passed

## Next Steps:
1. ⬜️ Batch KV operations with Promise.all
2. ⬜️ Make request context creation synchronous
3. ⬜️ Implement configuration caching
