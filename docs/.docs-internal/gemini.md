## Phase 1: Archive Processing (`docs/archive/`)

**Objective:** Triage the contents of the `docs/archive/` directory, integrating still-relevant information into the main documentation and clearly separating or removing purely historical/superseded content.

**Priority:** High - This phase enables other documentation improvements by identifying what's current vs. historical.

**Estimated Time:** 6 hours

**Dependencies:** None - This is a foundational step.

**Steps:**

1.  **Inventory & Review:** Go through each file within `docs/archive/`.
    - Create a spreadsheet tracking each file with columns: filename, key concepts, status (superseded/relevant/partially relevant), destination (if relevant)
    - Categorize files by topic (configuration, caching, architecture, etc.)

2.  **Identify Superseded Content:** Mark files or sections that are completely outdated (e.g., initial design docs for features that have significantly changed, old progress reports).
    - *Action:* Create a new `docs/archive/superseded/` sub-directory
    - Move identified files using structured commit messages noting why each file is superseded

3.  **Identify Relevant Context:** Find information that, while historical, provides valuable context for understanding current design decisions or features.
    - Focus specifically on: KV caching rationale, configuration API evolution, architecture decisions

4.  **Extract & Integrate:**
    - Copy relevant snippets or summaries from archive files
    - For each destination file, create a new section titled "Historical Context" or "Design Evolution"
    - Add extracted information with clear attribution to the original document
    - Add "Last Updated" dates to all modified files

5.  **Update Archive README:** 
    - Create a comprehensive index in `docs/archive/README.md` explaining:
      - Purpose of the archive directory
      - What was moved to superseded and why
      - What valuable historical context remains and where
      - How to reference archived documents

**Validation Criteria:**
- Archive README is updated with clear organization explanation
- Superseded directory is created with moved files
- All extracted historical context is properly integrated with attribution
- Tracking spreadsheet is complete with status of all archive files
