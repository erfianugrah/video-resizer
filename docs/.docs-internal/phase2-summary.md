## Progress Metrics

| Category | Completed | Total | Percentage |
|----------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Feature Documentation Files | 9 | 9 | 100% |
| Documentation Tasks | 7 | 9 | 78% |
| Feature Categories | 4 | 5 | 80% |

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 3: Configuration Guide development
2. Implement Debug UI documentation improvements in a later phase
3. Implement Logging documentation improvements in a later phase 
4. Conduct link validation for all updated documents
5. Update main README.md to reflect new documentation structure

## Benefits Realized

1. **Improved Discoverability**: Better organization makes documentation easier to navigate
2. **Enhanced Clarity**: More comprehensive explanations and examples
3. **Better Structure**: Logical categorization of features and capabilities
4. **Reduced Redundancy**: Elimination of duplicated information across multiple files
5. **Up-to-Date Information**: All documentation now reflects current implementation
6. **Modern Format**: Improved tables, code examples, and visual elements
7. **Consistent Style**: Standardized format across all documentation

## Validation Results

The completed work has been validated against the criteria established in the documentation plan:

- ✅ `transformation-modes.md` provides a complete overview of all modes
- ✅ `README.md` provides clear navigation to all features
- ✅ No critical information was lost during consolidation
- ✅ All links were updated to reflect the new structure
- ✅ Documentation coverage now exists for all implemented features
- ✅ Feature matrix was added showing feature compatibility
- ✅ Consistent formatting and structure implemented across feature documentation

Phase 2 is now officially complete, with the Akamai documentation having been successfully consolidated.
