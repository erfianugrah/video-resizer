# Documentation Improvement Project History

This document consolidates the history and summaries of the eight-phase documentation improvement project completed for the video-resizer.

## Project Overview

The documentation improvement project was conducted from April 5-25, 2025, with the goal of enhancing the clarity, consistency, accuracy, and navigability of the project documentation. The project followed a structured eight-phase approach outlined in the [gemini.md](./gemini.md) master plan.
