# Cache API Implementation Cleanup

This document outlines the key issues and fixes made to improve the Cache API implementation in the video-resizer project.

## Issue: Code Structure and Duplication

The `cacheManagementService.ts` file had accumulated significant code duplication over time, leading to:

1. Duplicate declarations of variables like `requestUrl`, `baseUrl`, `matchedResponse`, etc.
2. Duplicated code for cache lookup strategies with both `simpleKey` and `simpleMatchRequest` variables
3. Multiple sections of code that accomplish the same thing in slightly different ways
4. TypeScript errors due to undefined variables (`hasRangeHeader`)

## Fix: Code Restructuring and Variable Definition

### 1. Fixed the TypeScript errors related to undefined `hasRangeHeader` variable

The variable `hasRangeHeader` was being referenced in the range request handling code, but wasn't defined in the local scope, causing TypeScript errors:

```typescript
// Error:
if (hasRangeHeader && matchedResponse.headers.get('Accept-Ranges') === 'bytes') {
  // Range request handling code...
}
```

The fix added proper initialization of the variable directly before its use:

```typescript
// Fix:
// Check if the original request had a Range header
const hasRangeHeader = request.headers.has('Range');

if (hasRangeHeader && matchedResponse.headers.get('Accept-Ranges') === 'bytes') {
  // Range request handling code...
}
```

This change ensures that the TypeScript type system properly knows about this variable.

### 2. Additional cleanup work (in progress)

The following areas still need further cleanup:

- Code between lines 908-953 that overlaps with lines 865-907
- Duplicate code blocks between lines 1456-1501
- Consistent naming conventions for cache key variables
- Simplification of error handling paths

## Previous Optimizations Made to the Caching Implementation

### 1. Vary Header Handling for CDN-CGI Transformed Responses

Implemented aggressive header handling for transformed responses:
- Simplified to bare minimum essential headers
- Completely removed the `Vary` header for maximum cache reliability
- Added detailed logging of headers before sanitization

### 2. Cache Key Enhancement

- Implemented simplified cache keys by stripping query parameters
- Used minimal headers for maximum consistency
- Added multi-strategy cache lookup (tries both simplified key and original request)

## Results

The cleanup and fixes have resulted in:

1. Fixed TypeScript errors
2. More maintainable code structure
3. Reliable caching behavior for transformed responses
4. Consistent handling of range requests from cache

All TypeScript errors have been fixed and the code now passes type checking. This makes the codebase more maintainable and reduces the risk of runtime errors related to cache operations.
