# KV Caching Performance Considerations

## Storage Limits

1. **KV Size Limits**
   - Maximum value size: 25MB per entry
   - Larger videos won't be cached in KV
   - Consider using range requests for large videos

2. **Namespace Limits**
   - Storage limit per namespace: Check your Cloudflare plan
   - Consider purging older or less frequently accessed variants

3. **Operation Limits**
   - Maximum of 50 list operations per second per namespace
   - Maximum of 1,000 key-value reads per second per namespace
   - Maximum of 1,000 key-value writes per second per namespace

## Latency

1. **Read Performance**
   - KV reads are generally fast (in the low milliseconds)
   - Reads are globally distributed for low latency from any region
   - Cold reads may be slightly slower than hot reads

2. **Write Performance**
   - KV writes can take longer (tens to hundreds of milliseconds)
   - We use background storage with `waitUntil()` to avoid impacting response time
   - Global propagation of writes can take up to 60 seconds

## Cost Optimization

1. **Read/Write Operations**
   - KV operations incur costs based on reads, writes, and stored data size
   - Check the [Cloudflare Workers KV pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/#workers-kv) for current rates

2. **Storage Costs**
   - Storage costs depend on the total size of stored data
   - Consider purging less frequently accessed variants
   - Use cache tags for efficient purging instead of individual key deletion

3. **TTL Optimization**
   - Set appropriate TTLs based on content update frequency
   - Longer TTLs reduce write operations but may serve stale content
   - Shorter TTLs ensure fresher content but increase write operations

## Strategies for Optimization

1. **Selective Caching**
   - Cache only frequently accessed variants
   - Use popularity metrics to decide what to cache
   - Consider not caching very large videos (>10MB)

2. **Batch Operations**
   - Batch reads and writes when possible
   - Use tombstones instead of immediate deletion
   - Schedule bulk purges during off-peak hours

3. **Cache Key Design**
   - Use consistent, deterministic key generation
   - Group related variants with similar prefixes for easier management
   - Include only relevant parameters in cache keys

## Future Improvements

1. **Analytics**
   - Track KV cache hit/miss rates
   - Monitor KV storage usage and limits
   - Analyze most frequently accessed variants

2. **Intelligent Caching**
   - Prioritize caching for popular variants
   - Automatically adjust TTLs based on access patterns
   - Pre-cache predicted transformations

3. **Advanced Purge Strategies**
   - Implement LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
   - Time-based purging for older variants
   - Smart purging based on content updates

4. **Compression**
   - Compress video data before storing in KV
   - Store thumbnail/preview of videos instead of full videos
   - Use progressive loading techniques

## Benchmarking

To benchmark KV caching performance:

1. **Response Time**
   - Compare response times with and without KV caching
   - Measure cold vs. warm cache performance
   - Test from different geographic regions

2. **Worker CPU Usage**
   - Measure CPU time saved by serving from KV cache
   - Compare computation costs with and without caching
   - Analyze impact on worker limits

3. **Origin Load**
   - Measure reduction in requests to origin servers
   - Calculate bandwidth savings
   - Analyze impact during traffic spikes
