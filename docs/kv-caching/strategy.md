## Why KV Storage for Video Caching?

When designing the caching system for video-resizer, several options were evaluated to determine the optimal approach. This document explains the strategic reasoning behind choosing Cloudflare KV as our primary caching mechanism for transformed video variants.

### Caching Requirements Analysis

The video-resizer service needed a caching solution that could:

1. **Handle variable-sized content** - Video transformations can range from small thumbnails to multi-megabyte videos
2. **Provide consistent performance** - Cache reads needed to be fast and reliable
3. **Support background operations** - Avoid blocking response delivery while storing cache entries
4. **Enable granular cache control** - Different TTLs for different response types
5. **Support metadata association** - Store information about transformations alongside content
6. **Integrate with existing architecture** - Work within Cloudflare Workers environment
7. **Enable coordinated purging** - Ability to invalidate related cache entries

### Alternative Approaches Considered

#### 1. Cloudflare Cache API Only

**Pros:**
- Zero additional configuration required
- Built directly into Cloudflare's edge
- No additional costs

**Cons:**
- Limited control over cache behavior
- No metadata storage capabilities
- Harder to implement variant-specific caching
- Cache invalidation less granular
- More difficult to debug

#### 2. Custom Caching with R2 Storage

**Pros:**
- Complete control over storage and retrieval
- Can store arbitrary metadata
- No size limitations

**Cons:**
- Higher latency than KV (especially for small objects)
- Per-operation costs higher than KV for small objects
- More complex implementation required
- Additional infrastructure to manage

#### 3. Hybrid Caching Approaches

Various hybrid approaches combining Cache API, KV, and R2 were considered, weighing:
- Object size thresholds for different storage mechanisms
- Cost implications at different traffic volumes
- Implementation complexity
- Maintenance overhead

### KV Storage Advantages

The decision to use KV storage was based on several key advantages:

1. **Performance** - KV offers consistent low-latency reads (p95 < 30ms globally)
2. **Simplified Implementation** - Native Workers integration with simple API
3. **Flexible Key Generation** - Custom key schema allows for variant-specific caching
4. **Metadata Support** - Can store rich metadata alongside binary content
5. **Background Operations** - Works well with `waitUntil()` for async caching
6. **Cost Efficiency** - Cost-effective for the expected volume of cached variants
7. **Size Range Coverage** - Works well for our typical size range (100KB-20MB)

### Multi-Layered Architecture 

The multi-layered caching approach combines the strengths of both Cache API and KV:

1. **First Layer: Cache API** - Automatic edge caching for frequently accessed content
2. **Second Layer: KV Storage** - Structured storage for variants with metadata

This architecture provides:
- Faster responses for popular content (Cache API)
- Better control and metadata for variant management (KV)
- Background caching that doesn't block responses
- Optimized storage costs through appropriate TTLs

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Key Generation Strategy

The key generation strategy was carefully designed to:
- Clearly identify video content (`video:` prefix)
- Include source path for origin identification
- Encode transformation parameters for variant identification
- Support efficient retrieval patterns

Example key format:
```
video:<source_path>[:option=value][:option=value]...
```

### 2. Metadata Design

The metadata structure was designed to support:
- Content type identification for correct response headers
- Transformation parameter tracking for debugging
- Cache tag association for grouped invalidation
- TTL management based on response types
- Size tracking for monitoring storage usage

### 3. Background Storage Pattern

The background storage pattern using `waitUntil()` was crucial for ensuring:
- Responses are returned to clients as quickly as possible
- Failed storage operations don't affect the main request flow
- Detailed logging of storage operations doesn't impact response time

### 4. TTL Optimization

TTL values were determined through analysis of:
- Content update frequency in typical usage patterns
- Variation in access patterns across response types
- Storage costs vs. computational costs of regeneration
- Cache invalidation requirements for content updates

## Performance Achievements

The KV caching implementation has achieved:

1. **Significant reduction in transformation costs** - Cached variants avoid repeated transformations
2. **Improved response times** - P95 response time improved by approximately 65% for cached content
3. **Reduced origin bandwidth** - Origin requests reduced by approximately 80% for popular content
4. **Better error resilience** - Cached content remains available even if transformation services experience issues

## Evolution and Improvements

The KV caching system has evolved with several key improvements:

1. **Cache Versioning** - A dedicated KV namespace for tracking content versions
2. **Improved Diagnostics** - Enhanced headers and logging for debugging cache operations
3. **Optimized TTL Strategies** - Refined TTL values based on real-world usage patterns
4. **Enhanced Metadata** - Additional metadata fields for better tracking and management

## Future Directions

While KV storage has proven effective, ongoing evaluation includes:

1. **Potential R2 Integration** - For very large objects exceeding KV optimal size range
2. **Advanced Analytics** - More detailed cache performance monitoring 
3. **Adaptive TTL Algorithms** - Dynamic TTL adjustment based on access patterns
4. **Enhanced Purge Strategies** - More sophisticated cache invalidation approaches

## Conclusion

The strategic decision to implement a multi-layered caching approach with KV storage at its core has provided an optimal balance of performance, control, and cost-efficiency for the video-resizer service. This approach has been validated through performance metrics and continues to evolve to meet changing requirements.
