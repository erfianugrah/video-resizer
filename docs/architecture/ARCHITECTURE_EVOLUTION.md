# Architecture Evolution in Video Resizer

This document tracks the evolution of the Video Resizer architecture, key design decisions, and lessons learned throughout the development process.

## Initial Implementation (v0.1)

The initial implementation of Video Resizer focused on basic functionality with a minimal architecture:

### Architectural Approach

- Simple procedural code with minimal structure
- Direct use of Cloudflare Workers API
- Basic URL transformation and forwarding
- Limited error handling and configuration

### Key Components

- **index.ts**: Main entry point with request handling
- **transformer.ts**: URL transformation logic
- **config.js**: Basic configuration object

### Limitations

- Tightly coupled components
- No separation of concerns
- Limited error handling
- Hardcoded configuration values
- No caching strategy
- Poor testability
- Limited flexibility for different transformation types

## Service-Oriented Architecture (v0.2-v0.3)

The second phase introduced a service-oriented architecture to address the limitations of the initial implementation:

### Architectural Improvements

- **Service Layer**: Introduced specialized services
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration system
- **Error Handling**: Added structured error handling
- **Caching**: Basic caching implementation
- **Testing**: Unit tests for core functionality

### Key Components

- **Services**:
  - VideoTransformationService
  - CacheService
  - ConfigurationService
- **Handlers**:
  - videoHandler.ts
  - configHandler.ts
- **Utils**:
  - cacheUtils.ts
  - transformUtils.ts
  - errorUtils.ts

### Challenges Encountered

- **Circular Dependencies**: Services importing each other
- **Configuration Complexity**: Managing different environment configurations
- **Testing Difficulties**: Mocking dependencies
- **Error Propagation**: Inconsistent error handling
- **TypeScript Integration**: Proper typing of Worker APIs

### Solutions Applied

- **Dynamic Imports**: Used dynamic imports to break circular dependencies
- **Environment Configuration**: Added environment-specific configuration
- **Mock Services**: Created mock implementations for testing
- **Error Classes**: Defined structured error hierarchy
- **Type Definitions**: Added TypeScript definitions for Cloudflare APIs

## Command Pattern Implementation (v0.4-v0.5)

The third phase focused on implementing the command pattern to centralize business logic:

### Architectural Improvements

- **Command Pattern**: Added TransformVideoCommand
- **Parameter Extraction**: Improved option parsing
- **Dependency Injection**: Service dependencies injected into command
- **Structured Errors**: Enhanced error hierarchy
- **Configuration Manager**: Singleton configuration managers
- **Path Patterns**: Path-based configuration

### Key Components

- **Commands**:
  - TransformVideoCommand

- **Enhanced Services**:
  - DebugService
  - StorageService
- **Utilities**:
  - pathUtils.ts
  - loggerUtils.ts
  - requestContext.ts

### Design Decision: Command Pattern

The decision to implement the command pattern was driven by:

1. **Separation of Logic**: Keep business logic separate from request handling
2. **Testability**: Enable unit testing of business logic without HTTP context
3. **Reusability**: Allow the same command to be used in different contexts (API, scheduled task, etc.)
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each command has a specific purpose

The command pattern significantly improved code organization and testability but introduced the challenge of managing dependencies between commands and services.

## Strategy Pattern Implementation (v0.6-v0.7)

The fourth phase introduced the strategy pattern to handle different transformation modes:

### Architectural Improvements

### Key Components

- **Strategies**:
  - VideoStrategy
  - FrameStrategy
  - SpritesheetStrategy
- **Factories**:
  - StrategyFactory
- **Enhanced Configuration**:
  - Zod schema validation
  - KV-based dynamic configuration
- **Debug Components**:
  - Debug UI (Astro)
  - Diagnostics information
  - Performance tracking

### Design Decision: Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern was implemented to:

1. **Support Multiple Modes**: Handle video, frame, and spritesheet transformations
2. **Encapsulate Mode Logic**: Keep mode-specific code contained
3. **Simplify Extension**: Make it easy to add new transformation modes
4. **Standardize Interfaces**: Ensure consistent behavior across modes
5. **Improve Validation**: Implement mode-specific validation

This pattern successfully addressed the need for different transformation behaviors while maintaining a clean architecture.

4. **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
5. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
6. **Interface Segregation**: Specific interfaces are better than general ones
7. **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Dynamic Import Trade-offs

The use of dynamic imports to break circular dependencies was effective but introduced complexity:

**Problem**: Services had circular dependencies (A → B → C → A)

**Solution**: Used dynamic imports to break cycles

**Lesson**: While effective, this was a symptom of architectural issues that would be better solved through proper dependency inversion and interface-based design

### 2. Configuration Complexity

Managing configuration across environments proved challenging:

**Problem**: Different environments needed different configurations

**Solution**: Used wrangler.jsonc environments and KV-based configuration

**Lesson**: A centralized, typed, and validated configuration system is essential for maintainability

### 3. Testing Approach

Testing evolved significantly:

**Problem**: Initial tests were complex and brittle

**Solution**: Used dependency injection and mock services

**Lesson**: Design for testability from the start; interfaces and dependency injection are critical

### 4. Error Handling Strategy

Error handling improved through iterations:

**Problem**: Inconsistent error handling and poor user feedback

**Solution**: Implemented structured error hierarchy and centralized handling

**Lesson**: A comprehensive error system improves both user experience and developer experience

### 5. Performance Considerations

Performance optimization became increasingly important:

**Problem**: Cloudflare Workers have specific performance characteristics

**Solution**: Implemented multi-layer caching and request context tracking

**Lesson**: Understanding the platform's performance characteristics is essential for optimization
