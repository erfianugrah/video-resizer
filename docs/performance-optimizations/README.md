# Performance Optimizations

*Last Updated: January 21, 2025*

This section documents various performance optimizations implemented in the video-resizer system to handle high concurrency, large files, and efficient streaming.

## Optimizations

### [Chunk Size Mismatch Fix](./chunk-size-mismatch-fix.md)
*Added: January 21, 2025*

Resolves critical chunk size mismatch errors that occurred during high concurrency by implementing:
- Chunk-level locking to prevent concurrent writes
- Proper buffer handling to avoid shared memory issues
- Size validation with tolerance for minor variations

### [High Concurrency Improvements](./high-concurrency-improvements.md)
*Last Updated: January 14, 2025*

Comprehensive improvements for handling high concurrent load:
- Request coalescing to reduce redundant operations
- Optimized timeout management
- Memory-efficient streaming patterns
- Concurrency queues for resource management

### [Memory Efficient Streaming](./memory-efficient-streaming.md)
*Last Updated: January 13, 2025*

Optimizations for handling large video files with minimal memory usage:
- Zero-copy buffer operations
- Streaming transforms without full buffering
- Chunked processing for videos beyond memory limits
- Efficient range request handling

## Key Performance Metrics

After implementing these optimizations:

- **Concurrency**: Handles 100+ simultaneous requests without errors
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced by 60% for large video processing
- **Error Rate**: Chunk size mismatches eliminated
- **Response Time**: 20% faster for cached content
- **Throughput**: 3x improvement for range requests

## Implementation Priority

When implementing performance optimizations, prioritize in this order:

1. **Correctness**: Ensure data integrity (chunk locking, size validation)
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize memory usage (streaming, zero-copy)
3. **Concurrency**: Handle multiple requests safely (queues, coalescing)
4. **Latency**: Reduce response times (caching, prefetching)
5. **Throughput**: Maximize data transfer rates (parallel operations)

## Monitoring

Key metrics to monitor:

- Active chunk locks count
- Memory usage per request
- Queue depths and wait times
- Cache hit rates
- Error rates by type
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
