## Architectural Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Video Resizer** | Cloudflare Worker application that transforms video URLs to use Cloudflare's Media Transformation capabilities |
| **Strategy Pattern** | Design pattern used to implement different transformation modes (video, frame, spritesheet) with polymorphic behavior |
| **Command Pattern** | Design pattern used to encapsulate video transformation operations as discrete commands |
| **Dependency Injection** | Pattern where a service's dependencies are provided from external sources rather than created internally |
| **Service** | Class responsible for a specific domain of functionality such as transformation, caching, or configuration |
| **Handler** | Function that processes incoming requests and orchestrates service interactions |
| **Domain-Driven Design** | Design approach focused on modeling based on the domain's logic and concepts |
| **Configuration Manager** | Singleton class responsible for managing a specific area of configuration |

## Configuration Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Path Pattern** | Regular expression pattern used to match URLs for transformation processing |
| **Capture Group** | Named group in a path pattern regex used to extract parameters from URLs |
| **Environment Configuration** | Configuration specific to an environment (development, staging, production) |
| **Dynamic Configuration** | Configuration stored in KV that can be updated without redeploying the worker |
| **Static Configuration** | Configuration defined in wrangler.jsonc that requires redeployment to update |
| **Unified Origins** | Configuration approach that consolidates multiple content origins into a single configuration |
| **Parameter Mapping** | Configuration that maps URL parameters to transformation options |
| **Wrangler** | CLI tool for developing and deploying Cloudflare Workers |

## Transformation Modes

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Video Mode** | Transformation mode that processes complete videos, preserving motion and audio |
| **Frame Mode** | Transformation mode that extracts a single still image from a specific timestamp in a video |
| **Spritesheet Mode** | Transformation mode that generates a grid of thumbnails showing progression through a video |
| **Derivative** | Predefined set of transformation parameters optimized for a specific use case |
| **Quality Preset** | Predefined combination of video quality settings (low, medium, high) |
| **Format** | Output video format (mp4, webm) or image format for extracted frames (jpg, png, webp) |
| **Fit Mode** | How video content fits within specified dimensions (contain, cover, crop, scale-down, pad) |
| **Transformation Strategy** | Implementation of a specific transformation approach (video, frame, spritesheet) |

## Video Parameters

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **width** | Parameter that specifies the width in pixels of the output video or image |
| **height** | Parameter that specifies the height in pixels of the output video or image |
| **fit** | Parameter that controls how the video fits within specified dimensions |
| **quality** | Parameter that controls the quality/compression level of the output |
| **compression** | Parameter that controls the video compression level (low, medium, high, auto) |
| **format** | Parameter that specifies the output format (mp4, webm for video; jpg, png, webp for frames) |
| **time** | Parameter that specifies the timestamp for frame extraction (e.g., "30s") |
| **duration** | Parameter that specifies the length of video to include in a spritesheet or clip |
| **loop** | Parameter that controls whether video should loop during playback |
| **autoplay** | Parameter that controls whether video should automatically start playing |
| **muted** | Parameter that controls whether video audio should be muted |
| **preload** | Parameter that controls how video should be preloaded (none, metadata, auto) |

## Caching Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **KV Cache** | Cloudflare Key-Value storage used for caching transformed content globally |
| **Cache API** | Cloudflare's Cache API for storing responses in edge caches |
| **TTL** | Time-to-live duration controlling how long content remains in cache |
| **Cache Versioning** | System for managing different versions of cached content, enabling controlled invalidation |
| **Cache Key** | Unique identifier for cached content, typically based on source URL and transformation parameters |
| **Range Request** | HTTP request that specifies a byte range of content, used for video seeking and streaming |
| **Cache Tag** | Label attached to cached content enabling grouped invalidation of related items |
| **Cache Strategy** | Approach for determining what and how to cache different types of content |
| **Origin Pull** | Process of fetching content from the origin server when not in cache |

## Integration Features

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **IMQuery** | Responsive image query system for dimension-based transformations |
| **Client Hints** | HTTP headers that provide client device information used for adaptive responses |
| **Breakpoint** | Screen width threshold used for responsive design decisions |
| **Derivative Mapping** | System that maps responsive dimensions to predefined video derivatives |
| **Responsive Width** | Width calculation based on device characteristics and viewport dimensions |
| **Akamai Compatibility** | Translation of Akamai-style parameters to Cloudflare format |
| **Presigned URL** | Security feature providing time-limited, signature-validated access to content |
| **S3 Authentication** | Authentication method for accessing content in S3-compatible storage |

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Debug Mode** | Feature that enables detailed debugging information in responses |
| **Debug UI** | Web interface for viewing detailed transformation and request diagnostics |
| **Debug Headers** | HTTP headers containing debugging information about request processing |
| **Debug View Mode** | Mode that renders debugging information in an HTML interface |
| **Diagnostics** | Information collected to help troubleshoot issues in request processing |
| **Performance Metrics** | Measurements of processing time and resource usage during request handling |
| **Breadcrumb Trail** | Sequential tracking of request processing events for debugging |
| **Debug Query Parameter** | URL parameter (typically `debug=view`) that enables debugging features |

## Security Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Origin Authentication** | Method for authenticating requests to origin storage services |
