# Presigned URL Caching Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for caching AWS S3 presigned URLs within the video-resizer service. The goal is to optimize performance by reusing presigned URLs for the same assets, reducing latency and AWS API calls.

## Timeline

| Phase | Description | Estimated Duration |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Design and Documentation | 1 day |
| 2 | Core Service Implementation | 2 days |
| 3 | Integration with VideoStorageService | 1 day |
| 4 | Testing and Validation | 2 days |
| 5 | Monitoring and Rollout | 1 day |
| **Total** | | **7 days** |

## Phase 1: Design and Documentation

### Tasks:
- [x] Create comprehensive design document
- [ ] Review design with team members
- [ ] Set up KV namespace in Cloudflare dashboard
- [ ] Update wrangler configuration

### Deliverables:
- Detailed technical design document
- Updated wrangler.jsonc with new KV namespace

## Phase 2: Core Service Implementation

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `src/services/presignedUrlCacheService.ts`
- [ ] Implement cache entry interface and type definitions
- [ ] Develop key generation algorithm
- [ ] Write methods for storing and retrieving URLs
- [ ] Implement TTL management and URL expiration logic
- [ ] Add background refresh mechanism for expiring URLs
- [ ] Write unit tests for all functions

### Deliverables:
- Complete `presignedUrlCacheService.ts` implementation
- Unit test suite for the service

## Phase 3: Integration with VideoStorageService

### Tasks:
- [ ] Modify `fetchFromRemoteImpl` to check cache before generating URLs
- [ ] Modify `fetchFromFallbackImpl` to check cache before generating URLs
- [ ] Add cache storage logic after successful URL generation
- [ ] Implement background refresh using waitUntil
- [ ] Add diagnostic information for cache hits/misses
- [ ] Update logging to include cache operations

### Deliverables:
- Updated `videoStorageService.ts` with cache integration
- Comprehensive logging for cache operations

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create integration tests for the caching system
- [ ] Test with actual AWS S3 buckets in development environment
- [ ] Measure performance improvements for repeated requests
- [ ] Validate edge cases (e.g., near-expiration, errors, timeouts)
- [ ] Test high-concurrency scenarios
- [ ] Verify cache invalidation works correctly

### Deliverables:
- Test results documenting performance improvements
- Validated solution with edge case handling

## Phase 5: Monitoring and Rollout

### Tasks:
- [ ] Add metrics for cache hit/miss rates
- [ ] Create dashboard for cache performance
- [ ] Document operational procedures for maintenance
- [ ] Gradual rollout to production environment
- [ ] Monitor for any issues during rollout

### Deliverables:
- Monitoring dashboard for cache performance
- Operational documentation for the team
- Successfully deployed solution in production

## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Interface

```typescript
// Key interfaces
interface PresignedUrlCacheEntry {
  url: string;              // The presigned URL
  originalUrl: string;      // Original URL before signing
  createdAt: number;        // Generation timestamp
  expiresAt: number;        // Expiration timestamp
  path: string;             // Asset path
  storageType: string;      // 'remote' or 'fallback'
  authType: string;         // Authentication type
  region?: string;          // AWS region
  service?: string;         // AWS service
}

// Key methods
function generatePresignedUrlKey(path, options): string
async function storePresignedUrl(namespace, path, url, options): Promise<boolean>
async function getPresignedUrl(namespace, path, options): Promise<PresignedUrlCacheEntry | null>
function isUrlExpiring(entry, thresholdSeconds): boolean
async function refreshPresignedUrl(namespace, entry, options): Promise<boolean>
```

### Integration Code Structure

The implementation will follow the pattern established in the codebase:

1. Core service with standardized error handling
2. Integration at AWS S3 presigned URL generation points
3. Background refresh using waitUntil when appropriate
4. Comprehensive logging with consistent format

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| KV rate limits | High | Low | Implement exponential backoff retry pattern for KV operations |
| Stale URLs served | High | Low | Set cache TTL conservatively below actual expiration time |
| Cache thrashing | Medium | Medium | Monitor cache efficiency and adjust TTL strategy as needed |
| Implementation bugs | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive test suite with edge cases |
| Performance overhead | Low | Low | Measure performance before and after implementation |

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: >50ms reduction in average response time
- **Efficiency**: >80% reduction in AWS SDK calls for presigned URL generation
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90% for frequently accessed assets
- **Stability**: Zero incidents related to URL expiration

## Maintenance Considerations

- Monitoring KV namespace usage and limits
- Regular review of cache hit rates and efficiency
- Procedure for clearing cache during credential rotation
- Documentation for operators and support team
