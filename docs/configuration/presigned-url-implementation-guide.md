# Presigned URL Implementation Guide

This guide provides a detailed overview of the presigned URL implementation in the video-resizer project, including the current state, implementation details, and future enhancements.

## Overview

The presigned URL implementation allows the video-resizer service to securely access private content stored in S3 buckets. This implementation includes:

1. Generation of AWS S3 presigned URLs
2. Caching of presigned URLs to improve performance
3. Automatic refresh of expiring URLs
4. Integration with the CDN transformation pipeline

## Current Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Presigned URL Utilities (`presignedUrlUtils.ts`)
- `needsPresigning()`: Determines if a URL requires presigning
- `getAuthConfig()`: Extracts authentication configuration
- `getOrGeneratePresignedUrl()`: Main function for generating and retrieving cached URLs
- `extractPath()`: Extracts the path from a URL for use in presigning

#### 2. Presigned URL Cache Service (`presignedUrlCacheService.ts`)
- `generatePresignedUrlKey()`: Creates consistent cache keys
- `storePresignedUrl()`: Stores URLs in KV storage with metadata
- `getPresignedUrl()`: Retrieves cached URLs with expiration checking
- `isUrlExpiring()`: Determines if a URL is nearing expiration
- `refreshPresignedUrl()`: Refreshes URLs that are nearing expiration

#### 3. Path Utilities (`pathUtils.ts`)
- `buildCdnCgiMediaUrlAsync()`: Builds URLs with presigning support
- Handles presigned URL integration with transformation parameters

#### 4. Transformation Service (`TransformationService.ts`)
- Orchestrates video transformation with presigned URL support
- Passes path pattern context for proper presigning

### Current Flow

1. Request comes in and matches a path pattern
2. Video URL is constructed based on the matched pattern
3. System checks if presigning is needed based on configuration
4. If needed, generates or retrieves a presigned URL from cache
5. Integrates the presigned URL with transformation parameters
6. Returns the final transformed URL for client consumption

## Known Issues

1. Path extraction can be problematic when URLs contain multiple path segments
2. Presigned URL generation may fail if AWS credentials are not properly configured
3. Cache key generation may not be optimal for all use cases

## Implementation Plan for Enhancements

We've identified several areas for improvement and have developed a phased implementation plan:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Configuration
- Complete KV namespace setup for all environments
- Configure and secure AWS credentials
- Document credential management process

### Phase 2: Core Service Integration
- Enhance videoStorageService with background refresh
- Optimize error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Add diagnostic information for cache operations

### Phase 3: Cache Management and Optimization
- Improve cache key generation
- Implement proactive background refresh
- Add batch operations for multiple URL refreshes

### Phase 4: Performance Tuning and Monitoring
- Fine-tune cache TTL values
- Add detailed metrics for cache performance
- Create monitoring dashboard and alerts

### Phase 5: Documentation and Rollout
- Complete operational documentation
- Define gradual deployment strategy
- Add feature flags for progressive enablement

### Phase 6: Security Hardening
- Implement secure credential handling
- Add audit logging for security events
- Enhance access controls

### Phase 7: Future Enhancements
- Support multiple cloud storage providers
- Implement smart prefetching based on access patterns
- Add cache warming capabilities

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: >50ms reduction in average response time
- **Reliability**: >99.9% success rate for URL operations
- **Efficiency**: >90% cache hit rate for frequent assets
- **Resource Usage**: <5% increase in worker CPU utilization
- **User Experience**: Seamless fallbacks and consistent performance

## Implementation Progress

- ✅ Core presigning functionality implemented
- ✅ Basic KV caching implemented
- ✅ Integration with transformation pipeline complete
- ✅ Expiration detection implemented
- ❌ Monitoring and metrics pending
- ❌ Advanced cache management pending
- ❌ Security hardening partially implemented

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test each utility function independently
   - Mock KV storage for cache operations
   - Verify URL construction and transformation

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test end-to-end flow with real storage providers
   - Validate cache behavior with actual KV storage
   - Test expiration and refresh scenarios

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure latency impact of presigning
   - Test cache hit/miss performance
   - Evaluate concurrent request handling

4. **Security Testing**
   - Verify credential handling
   - Test URL signature validation
   - Check for information leakage

## Configuration Guide

### KV Namespace Configuration

```json
{
  "kv_namespaces": [
    {
      "binding": "PRESIGNED_URLS",
      "id": "your-kv-namespace-id",
      "preview_id": "your-preview-kv-namespace-id"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Access key for AWS authentication
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Secret key for AWS authentication
- `AWS_REGION`: Default AWS region for operations

### Path Pattern Configuration

```json
{
  "pathPatterns": [
    {
      "pattern": "/videos/(.*)",
      "originUrl": "https://your-s3-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com",
      "auth": {
        "type": "aws",
        "service": "s3",
        "region": "us-east-1",
        "accessKeyVar": "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
        "secretKeyVar": "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
        "expiresInSeconds": 3600
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Credential Management**
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Use environment-specific credentials
   - Consider using temporary credentials

2. **Cache Tuning**
   - Set appropriate TTLs based on content type
   - Monitor cache hit rates
   - Implement proactive refreshing for critical assets

3. **Error Handling**
   - Always have fallback mechanisms
   - Log detailed error information
   - Implement circuit breakers for failing services

4. **Monitoring**
   - Track cache hit/miss rates
   - Monitor URL generation failures
   - Set alerts for expiration-related issues

## Future Considerations

1. **Multi-provider Support**
   - Azure Blob Storage integration
   - Google Cloud Storage support
   - Generic interface for different providers

2. **Advanced Caching**
   - Access pattern-based warming
   - Content-aware TTL configuration
   - Geographic distribution of cache

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - IP-based restrictions
   - Advanced access controls
   - Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns

## Conclusion

The presigned URL implementation provides a robust solution for securely accessing private content while maintaining performance and reliability. The planned enhancements will further improve the system's capabilities and ensure it meets the evolving needs of the video-resizer service.
