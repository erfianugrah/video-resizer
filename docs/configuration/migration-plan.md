# Migration Plan: From Wrangler.jsonc to KV Configuration

This document outlines a phased approach for migrating configuration from `wrangler.jsonc` to KV-stored JSON.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

**Goal**: Establish the technical foundation for KV-based configuration.

- [x] Create KV namespace for configuration storage
- [x] Update wrangler.jsonc with KV namespace binding
- [x] Implement ConfigurationService for reading/writing config
- [x] Create endpoints for configuration management
- [x] Develop CLI tools for uploading configurations

## Phase 2: Initial Configuration Migration

**Goal**: Create initial JSON configurations while maintaining backward compatibility.

- [x] Extract development configuration to dev-config.json
- [x] Extract production configuration to prod-config.json
- [x] Validate generated configurations 
- [ ] Upload configurations to respective environments
- [ ] Test configuration loading in development environment

## Phase 3: Dual Configuration Mode

**Goal**: Support both environment variables and KV configuration simultaneously.

- [ ] Modify initialization process to try KV first, then fall back to environment variables
- [ ] Add logging to track which configuration source is being used
- [ ] Implement refresh mechanism for configuration updates
- [ ] Test full application functionality using KV configuration
- [ ] Create dashboard to view current active configuration

## Phase 4: Complete Migration

**Goal**: Finalize migration and remove environment variable dependencies.

- [ ] Remove redundant configuration from wrangler.jsonc
- [ ] Update configuration documentation
- [ ] Train team on new configuration workflow
- [ ] Create CI/CD integration for configuration updates
- [ ] Implement monitoring for configuration changes

## Phase 5: Enhancements

**Goal**: Extend the configuration system with additional features.

- [ ] Add configuration versioning
- [ ] Implement rollback functionality
- [ ] Create audit logging for configuration changes
- [ ] Build web interface for configuration management
- [ ] Add A/B testing capabilities via configuration

## Testing Strategy

For each phase:

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify configuration loading, validation, and parsing
2. **Integration Tests**: Test configuration impact on application behavior
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Full system functionality with KV configuration
4. **Performance Tests**: Measure impact of KV reads on request latency

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. Revert to environment variable configuration by setting `USE_KV_CONFIG=false`
2. Log all configuration-related errors to diagnose issues
3. Retain previous wrangler.jsonc versions in version control
4. Maintain backup copies of KV configuration in the repository

## Completion Criteria

The migration is complete when:

1. All application configuration has been moved to KV
2. wrangler.jsonc contains only infrastructure settings
3. All environments are successfully using KV configuration
4. Documentation is updated to reflect the new approach
5. Team members are comfortable with the new workflow
