# Superseded Documentation

This directory contains documentation that has been fully superseded by newer content in the main documentation. These files are maintained for historical completeness but should not be referenced for current implementation details.

## Purpose of This Directory

Documents in this directory have been archived because:
1. The features described have been fully implemented or abandoned
2. The content has been completely integrated into newer documentation
3. The information is outdated and no longer applicable to the current system

## Finding Current Documentation

For current documentation on these topics, please refer to:

- **Configuration API**: See [Configuration Guide](../../configuration/README.md) and [Configuration Reference](../../configuration/CONFIGURATION_REFERENCE.md)
- **Debug UI**: See [Debug UI Documentation](../../../debug-ui/README.md) and [Debug Features](../../features/debug-ui/README.md)
- **Project Planning**: See [Architecture Roadmap](../../architecture/ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md)

## Historical Context

While the specific implementation details in these documents have been superseded, they may provide insight into the historical development process and decision-making that led to the current system architecture.

If you're researching the project history or trying to understand why certain design decisions were made, these documents may still have value when read with the understanding that they describe earlier iterations of the system.

## Last Updated

This directory organization was completed on April 25, 2025, as part of the documentation consolidation project.
