# Video Resizer: Next Steps

This document outlines the planned next steps for the Video Resizer project after implementing the comprehensive configuration management system.

## 1. Performance Optimization

### Caching Mechanisms
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed configuration values
- [ ] Add configuration value versioning to invalidate caches when configs change
- [ ] Create a cache warming system for common configuration queries

### Lazy Loading
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for expensive configuration operations
- [ ] Defer validation of unused configuration sections until needed
- [ ] Use dynamic imports for configuration modules to reduce cold start times

### Profiling and Metrics
- [x] Add performance profiling for configuration access patterns
- [x] Implement metrics collection for configuration usage
- [x] Create dashboards for monitoring configuration performance

### Runtime Updates
- [ ] Implement a configuration hot-reload system
- [ ] Add support for live configuration updates without service restart
- [ ] Create webhook endpoints for configuration change notifications

## 2. Strategy Refinements

### Cache Strategies
- [x] Implement specialized cache strategies with granular TTLs based on status codes
- [x] Add support for explicit control of cacheEverything behavior via useTtlByStatus
- [x] Implement schema validation and backward compatibility for legacy TTL configs
- [ ] Implement the Strategy pattern for different caching mechanisms
- [ ] Create adaptive caching based on content popularity
- [ ] Add TTL optimization based on update frequency patterns

### Content Negotiation
- [ ] Implement content negotiation strategies based on Accept headers
- [ ] Add quality selection based on bandwidth estimation
- [ ] Create format selection based on browser capabilities

### Configuration Integration
- [ ] Replace direct usage of videoConfig with ConfigurationManager in remaining components
- [ ] Update strategies to use the configuration system for all settings
- [ ] Implement configuration-based feature toggles

## 3. Testing Improvements

### Strategy Testing
- [ ] Add specific tests for each strategy implementation
- [ ] Create parameterized tests for all transformation types
- [ ] Add edge case testing for strategy selection logic

### Error Handling
- [ ] Expand error handling tests to cover all error scenarios
- [ ] Test error propagation across service boundaries
- [ ] Create failure injection testing for robust error handling

### Configuration Testing
- [ ] Add tests for configuration loading from environment variables
- [ ] Test configuration validation with invalid inputs
- [ ] Create property-based tests for configuration validation

## 4. Developer Experience

### Administration Interface
- [ ] Create a web-based administration interface for configuration management
- [ ] Implement role-based access control for configuration changes
- [ ] Add audit logging for configuration modifications

### Debug UI Enhancements
- [ ] Redesign debug UI using Astro for better performance and developer experience
- [ ] Implement shadcn/ui components for a consistent, accessible interface
- [ ] Add interactive configuration editor with validation
- [ ] Create visual diff view for configuration changes
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile debugging

### Diagnostic Tools
- [ ] Add configuration diagnostic endpoints
- [ ] Implement configuration validation debug tools
- [ ] Create visualization tools for configuration dependencies

### Logging & Observability
- [ ] Add configuration change logging with diff view

- [x] Implement advanced timing metrics for performance bottleneck detection

## 5. Documentation Expansion

### Public Interface Documentation
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public interfaces
- [ ] Generate API documentation from JSDoc comments
- [ ] Create reference documentation for configuration schemas

### Configuration Examples
