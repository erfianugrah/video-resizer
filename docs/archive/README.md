# Archive Documentation: Organization & Status

This directory contains documentation that is preserved for historical context and reference. The archive has been carefully organized to differentiate between superseded documents and those containing valuable historical insights.

## Archive Organization

The archive is organized into two main sections:

1. **Current Archive Directory**: Contains historically valuable documents that provide important context, rationale, and decision-making background. These documents may contain outdated specifics but offer insights into design decisions.

2. **[Superseded Directory](./superseded/)**: Contains wholly outdated documents that have been fully replaced by current documentation. These are preserved for historical completeness but should not be referenced for current implementation details.

## Historical Context Integration

Key historical context and design decisions from these archived documents have been integrated into the current documentation in the following locations:

1. **KV Caching Rationale**: The fundamental reasons for choosing KV caching over alternatives are now documented in [KV Caching Strategy](../kv-caching/strategy.md) (created from KV_CACHING.md)

2. **Configuration Evolution**: The evolution of the configuration API and its design choices are preserved in [Configuration Loading](../configuration/configuration-loading.md)

3. **Debug UI Architecture**: The architecture decisions for the Debug UI are documented in the [Debug UI README](../../debug-ui/README.md)

4. **Path Matching Design**: The rationale behind the path matching system design is preserved in [Path Pattern Matching](../configuration/path-pattern-matching.md)

## Using Archived Documentation

When referencing archived documents:

1. **Check Status**: Consult the status table above to determine relevance
2. **Verify Against Current Docs**: Always cross-reference with current documentation
3. **Consider Context**: Understand that implementation details may differ from original plans
4. **Cite Appropriately**: When referencing archived content in new documentation, note its historical nature

## Last Updated

This archive organization was completed on April 25, 2025, as part of the documentation consolidation project. The evaluation criteria included:
- Implementation status in the current codebase
- Alignment with current architecture
- Historical value of design decisions and rationale
- Relevance to understanding current system behavior
