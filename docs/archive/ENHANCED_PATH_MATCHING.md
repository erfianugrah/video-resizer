# Enhanced Path Pattern Matching for Video Resizer

## Overview

This update introduces a more robust path pattern matching system to address issues with URL transformations in the video-resizer. The enhanced system provides:

1. Reliable synchronous access to path patterns
2. Better error handling and debugging
3. Default patterns when none are configured
4. Improved logging of the matching process
5. Support for fallback modes

## Key Components

### 1. Enhanced Path Utils

The `enhancedPathUtils.ts` module provides improved functions for pattern matching:

- `findMatchingPathPattern`: Matches a URL against configured path patterns with detailed debugging
- `transformUrl`: Transforms a URL based on the matching pattern
- `validatePathPatterns`: Validates path patterns to ensure they're properly formatted

### 2. Robust Configuration Manager

The `RobustVideoConfigurationManager` class provides reliable access to video configuration:

- Synchronous access to path patterns (avoids async issues during request handling)
- Fallback to default patterns when none are found
- Proper handling of different configuration structures (videoConfig vs modules.video)
- Detailed logging of the configuration loading process

### 3. Enhanced Video Handler

The `enhancedVideoHandler.ts` module provides an improved request handler:

- Direct, synchronous access to path patterns
- Detailed logging of each step in the process
- Proper error handling with helpful error messages
- Integration with existing services

## How It Works

1. When a request comes in, the system checks if it should use the enhanced handler based on:
   - URL parameter: `?useEnhanced=true`
   - Debug mode: `?debug=true`
   - Header: `x-use-enhanced-handler: true`

2. The enhanced handler:
   - Gets path patterns synchronously from the RobustVideoConfigurationManager
   - Uses default patterns if none are configured
   - Matches the URL against the patterns
   - Transforms the URL if a match is found
   - Applies options from both the pattern and URL parameters
   - Fetches the video from the transformed URL

3. Debug logging:
   - When debug mode is enabled, detailed logs show each step of the matching process
   - Pattern validation results are logged
   - URL transformation details are shown
   - All steps are traced with performance metrics

## Testing

A test page is available at `/test-video.html` to try different modes:

1. Standard video URL: `/rocky.mp4`
2. Enhanced handler: `/rocky.mp4?useEnhanced=true`
3. Enhanced with debug: `/rocky.mp4?useEnhanced=true&debug=true`

## Configuration

Path patterns should be configured in the video configuration:

```json
{
  "videoConfig": {
    "pathPatterns": [
      {
        "matcher": "^/(.*\\.mp4)",
        "transform": "/cdn-cgi/transform/video/$1",
        "options": {
          "quality": "auto",
          "compression": "auto"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Or in the modules.video structure:

```json
{
  "modules": {
    "video": {
      "pathPatterns": [
        {
          "matcher": "^/(.*\\.mp4)",
          "transform": "/cdn-cgi/transform/video/$1",
          "options": {
            "quality": "auto",
            "compression": "auto"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The system will correctly handle both formats.

## Default Patterns

If no patterns are configured, the system will use these defaults:

```javascript
[
  {
    matcher: "^/(.*\\.mp4)",
    transform: "/cdn-cgi/transform/video/$1",
    options: {
      quality: "auto",
      compression: "auto"
    }
  },
  {
    matcher: "^/(.*\\.webm)",
    transform: "/cdn-cgi/transform/video/$1",
    options: {
      quality: "auto"
    }
  },
  {
    matcher: "^/(.*\\.mov)",
    transform: "/cdn-cgi/transform/video/$1",
    options: {
      quality: "auto",
      format: "mp4"
    }
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

If videos aren't transforming correctly:

1. Access the URL with debug mode: `?debug=true&useEnhanced=true`
2. Check the console logs for detailed information about the matching process
3. Verify that path patterns are correctly configured and being loaded
4. Confirm the URL format matches the expected pattern
5. Check for 404 errors, which may indicate the transformed URL doesn't exist
