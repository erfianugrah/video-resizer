# Debug UI Enhancement Plan

## Current Architecture

The Debug UI is an Astro-based application that renders a diagnostic dashboard for the video resizer service. It's integrated with the main application via:

1. A debug parameter in the URL (`?debug=view`) that triggers debug mode
2. The `debugService.ts` service that collects diagnostic data and generates HTML
3. Diagnostic data injected into the debug page via `window.DIAGNOSTICS_DATA`
4. React components that render various sections of debug information

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Video Transformation Pipeline Visualization

**Objective**: Create a visual flowchart of the video processing pipeline to help identify bottlenecks.

**Implementation**:
- Create a new React component: `TransformationPipelineViewer.tsx`
- Extend `DiagnosticsInfo` to include detailed timing for each pipeline stage
- Use a timeline visualization library (e.g., react-timeline-flow)
- Display stages like: Request → Client Detection → Transform Parameter Resolution → Cache Check → Media Transformation → Response Generation
- Include timing data for each stage
- Highlight potential bottlenecks in red

### 2. Performance Dashboard with Time-Series Metrics

**Objective**: Add historical performance charts to track trends over time.

**Implementation**:
- Create a new tab in the Debug UI for historical metrics
- Use local storage to persist recent request metrics (last 50 requests)
- Implement `PerformanceMetricsCharts.tsx` with visualization libraries like Chart.js
- Display charts for:
  - Processing time trends
  - Cache hit/miss ratios
  - Transformation parameter usage
  - Error frequency
- Add filters to view metrics by device type, video format, etc.

### 3. A/B Configuration Testing Tool

**Objective**: Create a tool to compare different configuration settings and their impact.

**Implementation**:
- Create a new component: `ConfigurationComparer.tsx`
- Allow modifying configuration settings directly in the UI
- Add a "Test with this config" button that simulates transformations with modified settings
- Implement side-by-side visualization of original vs. modified configuration results
- Show performance impact of configuration changes
- Add ability to export configuration recommendations

### 4. Request Replayer with Parameter Modification

**Objective**: Enable replaying previous requests with altered parameters for debugging.

**Implementation**:
- Create a new component: `RequestReplayer.tsx`
- Add ability to save request details to local storage
- Create an interface to modify any transformation parameter
- Implement a way to replay the modified request
- Display side-by-side comparison of original vs. modified request results
- Include performance metrics for both requests

### 5. Network Condition Simulator

**Objective**: Simulate various network conditions to test adaptive delivery.

**Implementation**:
- Create a new component: `NetworkSimulator.tsx`
- Add network throttling options (Slow 3G, Fast 3G, 4G, etc.)
- Implement network condition simulation using the Network Information API where available
- Display simulated video loading times under different conditions
- Show adaptive quality selection based on network conditions
- Include recommendations for optimization

### 6. Visual Diff Tool for Video Transformations

**Objective**: Enable visual comparison between original and transformed videos.

**Implementation**:
- Create a new component: `VisualDiffViewer.tsx`
- Implement side-by-side video player with synchronized playback
- Add frame-by-frame comparison capability
- Display file size and quality metrics for both videos
- Include visual highlighting of differences between frames
- Add export capability for diff reports

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements (4 weeks)
1. Week 1-2: Extend diagnostic data collection
   - Update `debugService.ts` to collect detailed pipeline metrics
   - Extend `DiagnosticsInfo` interface with new fields
   - Add local storage for historical metrics

2. Week 3-4: Pipeline Visualization and Performance Dashboard
   - Implement TransformationPipelineViewer component
   - Implement PerformanceMetricsCharts component
   - Integrate with existing Debug UI

### Phase 2: Advanced Testing Tools (4 weeks)
3. Week 5-6: Configuration Testing and Request Replayer
   - Implement ConfigurationComparer component
   - Implement RequestReplayer component
   - Add API endpoints to support these features

4. Week 7-8: Network Simulation and Visual Diff
   - Implement NetworkSimulator component
   - Implement VisualDiffViewer component
   - Finalize integration testing

## Technical Considerations

1. **Data Collection**: Enhanced breadcrumb system for detailed pipeline tracing
2. **Storage**: Use combination of KV, local storage, and session storage for metrics
3. **Performance**: Ensure debug UI doesn't impact production performance
4. **Security**: Restrict debug access to authorized users only
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure debugging tools work across all modern browsers

## Success Metrics

1. Reduction in average debugging time per issue
2. Increase in proactive optimizations based on performance insights
3. Higher confidence in configuration changes
4. Improved documentation with visual debugging examples
5. Faster onboarding of new team members with visualization tools
