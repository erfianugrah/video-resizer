# Superseded IMQuery Documentation

This directory contains the original IMQuery documentation files that have been consolidated into the main IMQuery documentation structure. These files are maintained for historical reference but should not be used for current implementation details.

## Consolidated Documentation Structure

The information from these files has been reorganized into three main documents:

1. **[IMQuery Support](../README.md)** - Comprehensive overview of all IMQuery functionality
2. **[Breakpoint Mapping](../breakpoint-mapping.md)** - Detailed information about breakpoint-based derivative mapping
3. **[IMQuery Caching](../caching.md)** - In-depth documentation of the IMQuery caching system

## Superseded Files

| File | Content | Consolidated Into |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `IMQUERY_CACHING.md` | Detailed explanation of IMQuery caching behavior | [IMQuery Caching](../caching.md) |
| `imquery-caching-enhancement.md` | Recent improvements to the caching system | [IMQuery Caching](../caching.md) |
| `imquery-caching-fix.md` | Fixes for IMQuery caching issues | [IMQuery Caching](../caching.md) |
| `imquery-support.md` | Overview of IMQuery parameter handling | [IMQuery Support](../README.md) |
| `breakpoint-based-derivative-mapping.md` | Details of the breakpoint mapping system | [Breakpoint Mapping](../breakpoint-mapping.md) |

## Why We Consolidated

These files were consolidated to:
1. Provide a more cohesive documentation experience
2. Eliminate redundancy across multiple files
3. Create a clearer organizational structure
4. Ensure consistency in terminology and explanations
5. Make the documentation easier to maintain

## Historical Context

These original documents were written as the IMQuery support evolved over time, with each document addressing specific aspects or improvements. The consolidated documentation maintains all the valuable information while presenting it in a more structured and accessible format.
