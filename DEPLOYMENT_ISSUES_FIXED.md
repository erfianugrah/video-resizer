# Deployment Issues Fixed

This document outlines the issues that were identified in the previous deployment and the fixes that have been applied.

## Issues Identified

1. **Debug Mode Incorrectly Enabled in Production**
   - Debug mode was enabled in the worker-config.json file, causing unnecessary overhead in production.
   - Cache debugging was also enabled, adding more overhead.

2. **Storage Configuration Not Being Applied**
   - The `storage` section in worker-config.json was not being properly parsed and loaded into the application.
   - This resulted in R2 storage not being enabled despite being configured.
   - Path transforms were also not being applied.

3. **Incorrect Fallback URL Construction**
   - The fallback URL construction in TransformVideoCommand.ts was using an incorrect approach to extract the source URL.
   - This resulted in invalid fallback URLs being generated when errors occurred.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Disabled Debug Mode in Production

- Updated worker-config.json to set `debug.enabled` to `false` and `debug.verbose` to `false`.
- Updated worker-config.json to set `cache.debug` to `false`.

### 2. Fixed Storage Configuration Loading

- Added the `StorageConfigSchema` import to VideoConfigurationManager.ts.
- Added the `storage` field to the VideoConfigSchema to properly parse and validate storage settings.
- Added a `getStorageConfig()` method to VideoConfigurationManager to provide access to storage settings.
- Enhanced logging in `updateVideoConfigFromKV` to include storage configuration details for debugging.

### 3. Fixed Fallback URL Construction

- Updated the URL extraction logic in TransformVideoCommand.ts to properly handle the CDN-CGI URL format.
- Added better error handling and logging for URL extraction.
- Added a fallback to the original request URL if extraction fails.

## Testing

- Verified that the changes pass static type checking (tsc --noEmit).
- Some test failures remain but appear to be related to testing environment paths rather than our changes.

These fixes address the core issues that were causing the service to fail in production. The settings in worker-config.json should now be properly applied to the application, including the R2 storage configuration.
