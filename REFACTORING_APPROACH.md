# Refactoring Approach for video-resizer

Based on the analysis of the main branch vs. the refactor-2 branch, I've identified several key patterns and changes that need to be addressed to ensure successful integration of the refactored code.

## Key Architectural Changes in refactor-2

The refactor-2 branch has introduced several new architectural components not present in the main branch:

1. **New Core Architecture**
   - Added `/src/core` directory with interfaces and types
   - Implemented a service registry for dependency injection
   - Separated interfaces from implementations

2. **Factory Pattern Implementation**
   - Added `/src/factory` directory with factory methods
   - Implemented factories for various services and configurations
   - Reorganized dependency creation

3. **Bootstrap Process**
   - Added a dedicated bootstrap process
   - Separated initialization logic from request handling

## Integration Plan

To ensure successful integration with the main branch, the following approach is recommended:

### 1. Maintain Backward Compatibility

Since the main branch doesn't have the core/factory architecture, we need to ensure backward compatibility by:

- Keep existing service initialization patterns working alongside new ones
- Provide adapter patterns for existing code that expects singletons
- Maintain existing API signatures even with new implementation details

### 2. Incremental Migration Strategy

- Introduce interfaces and registries without breaking existing code paths
- Convert one module at a time to the new architecture
- Add comprehensive tests for each converted component

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Document the new architecture in the repository
- Update ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md to explain changes
- Create migration guides for other developers

## Specific Implementation Tasks

1. **Update Registry Implementation**
   - Ensure the ServiceRegistry works with existing singleton patterns
   - Add fallback initialization for services not registered with DI
   - Integrate with existing module patterns

2. **Factory Integration**
   - Modify factories to work with both traditional and DI-based initialization
   - Provide compatibility with existing service locations

3. **Interface Compliance**
   - Ensure all implementations adhere to their interfaces
   - Update existing implementations to match interface definitions

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create tests that verify both initialization paths
   - Ensure tests pass with both service initialization methods

## Overall Approach

The key to success with this refactoring is maintaining backward compatibility while incrementally improving the architecture. This means:

1. Never break existing functionality
2. Add new capabilities alongside existing ones
3. Provide both old and new ways to use the codebase
4. Document the changes and migration paths
5. Implement comprehensive testing

By following this approach, we can successfully integrate the architectural improvements without disrupting existing functionality or creating merge conflicts with the main branch.
