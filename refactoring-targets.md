# Refactoring Targets

The following files are the largest in the codebase and should be refactored:

1. ✅ `src/services/kvStorageService.ts` (2631 lines) → Refactored into 9 smaller files in `src/services/kvStorage/`
2. ✅ `src/services/videoStorageService.ts` (1927 lines) → Refactored into 9 smaller files in `src/services/videoStorage/`
3. ✅ `src/services/errorHandlerService.ts` (1426 lines) → Refactored into 5 smaller files in `src/services/errorHandler/`
4. ✅ `src/services/configurationService.ts` (1045 lines) → Refactored into 8 smaller files in `src/services/configuration/`
5. ✅ `src/utils/transformationUtils.ts` (1029 lines) → Refactored into 4 smaller files in `src/utils/transformation/`

## Refactoring Approach

For each file:
1. Create a backup (.bak) file
2. Split functions into separate files in an appropriate subdirectory
3. Export the functions from their new files
4. Import and re-export them from the original file
5. The original file becomes just the entry point

This maintains the same import paths for the rest of the codebase while making the code more maintainable.
