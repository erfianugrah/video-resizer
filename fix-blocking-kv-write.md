# Fix for Blocking KV Write in Cache Version Metadata

## Issue
The storage of cache version metadata in KV was potentially blocking the initial request because the `waitUntil` method was being accessed through `(env as any).executionCtx`, which might be undefined, causing a fallback to a blocking `await`.

## Solution
Modified the `TransformationService.ts` file to use a more reliable method to get the `ExecutionContext` for non-blocking operations:

1. Use `getCurrentContext()` to retrieve the current request context
2. Access the `executionContext` property from the `RequestContext`
3. Use `executionContext.waitUntil()` for non-blocking operations

## Changes Made
In `/src/services/TransformationService.ts`, replaced:

```typescript
// Store updated version in background if possible
if (env && 'executionCtx' in env && (env as any).executionCtx?.waitUntil) {
  (env as any).executionCtx.waitUntil(
    storeCacheKeyVersion(env, cacheKey, nextVersion, versionTtl)
  );
} else {
  // Fall back to direct storage
  await storeCacheKeyVersion(env, cacheKey, nextVersion, versionTtl);
}
```

With:

```typescript
// Store updated version in background if possible
const requestContextForWaitUntil = getCurrentContext(); // Get the current request context
const executionCtxForWaitUntil = requestContextForWaitUntil?.executionContext;

if (executionCtxForWaitUntil?.waitUntil) { // Use the context obtained from getCurrentContext()
  executionCtxForWaitUntil.waitUntil(
    storeCacheKeyVersion(env, cacheKey, nextVersion, versionTtl)
  );
} else {
  // Fall back to direct storage
  logDebug('Falling back to await for storeCacheKeyVersion, waitUntil not available via requestContext', { cacheKey });
  await storeCacheKeyVersion(env, cacheKey, nextVersion, versionTtl);
}
```

## Expected Benefits
- Ensures that the `storeCacheKeyVersion` operation runs in the background using `waitUntil` when possible
- Makes the main response sent to the client without waiting for this KV write to complete
- Provides better logging when falling back to a blocking operation
- Aligns with the pattern used in other parts of the codebase (like `kvCacheUtils.ts`)

## Verification
After deploying the changes, you should:

1. Monitor logs for the "Stored cache key version in metadata" breadcrumb (from `CacheVersionService.ts`).
   - The `durationMs` for this log entry should be significantly smaller, or the log might appear *after* the main response has been logged as sent, indicating it ran in the background.
   - Look for the new log message: "Falling back to await for storeCacheKeyVersion, waitUntil not available via requestContext". If you see this, it means `waitUntil` is still not being accessed correctly, and further debugging would be needed.

2. Observe request times. The overall request processing time, especially for initial requests that trigger this version metadata write, should not show the distinct pause aligning with the KV write duration previously observed (339ms in the example from gemini.md).
