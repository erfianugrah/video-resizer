# Future Recommendations

This document outlines recommended improvements to further enhance the stability, performance, and maintainability of the video-resizer service.

## Configuration Management

1. **Configuration Validation Checks**
   - Add validation at startup that verifies the presence of critical configuration sections.
   - Log warnings when essential configurations like storage are missing or incomplete.
   - Add more extensive schema validation for each configuration section.

2. **Environment-Specific Configs**
   - Create separate worker-config.json files for different environments (dev, staging, production).
   - Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy the correct configuration for each environment.
   - Use environment variables to override critical settings when needed.

## Storage Service Improvements

1. **Storage Fallback Logic**
   - Enhance the fallback logic to be more resilient when one storage option fails.
   - Add circuit breakers to temporarily disable failing storage options.
   - Implement more detailed metrics and logging for storage operations.

2. **Path Transformation Testing**
   - Add comprehensive tests for path transformations across different storage types.
   - Create visualizations or debug tools to show how paths are transformed for different storage backends.

3. **Storage Configuration Validation**
   - Add pre-flight validation to ensure configured storage options are reachable.
   - Implement health checks for storage backends.
   - Add alerts for storage issues.

## Error Handling and Logging

1. **Structured Error Handling**
   - Implement a more structured approach to error handling with categorized error types.
   - Add correlation IDs for tracing errors across services.
   - Enhance error reporting with stack traces in debug environments.

2. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Implement log sampling based on request types to reduce log volume in production.
   - Add more structured logging for key operations.
   - Create specialized logging views for debugging specific components.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Integration Testing**
   - Add more comprehensive integration tests that cover the full request lifecycle.
   - Implement tests for KV configuration loading.
   - Add tests for fallback scenarios.

2. **Load Testing**
   - Implement load testing to verify performance under different traffic patterns.
   - Test the system's resilience to storage backend failures.
   - Create benchmarks for key operations.

## Monitoring and Alerting

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Add detailed performance metrics for each storage backend.
   - Track success rates, latencies, and error rates.
   - Set up alerts for performance degradation.

2. **Healthchecks**
   - Implement healthcheck endpoints that verify all components are functioning correctly.
   - Add synthetic monitoring to periodically test the service.
   - Create a dashboard to visualize service health.

## Deployment and Operations

1. **Canary Deployments**
   - Implement canary deployments to gradually roll out changes.
   - Set up automatic rollback mechanisms for failed deployments.
   - Add progressive feature flags for larger changes.

2. **Documentation**
   - Enhance documentation with detailed diagrams for the service architecture.
   - Create troubleshooting guides for common issues.
   - Document the configuration schema with examples for each section.

By implementing these recommendations, the video-resizer service will become more robust, easier to operate, and better prepared for future enhancements.
