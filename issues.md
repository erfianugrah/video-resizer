# ReadableStream Disturbance Issues

## Primary Issue
The error message "This ReadableStream is disturbed (has already been read from), and cannot be used as a body" indicates that a Response's body stream is being consumed multiple times.

## Key Problematic Locations

### 1. In `videoHandlerWithOrigins.ts` (line 379-380)
```typescript
// Create a clone for KV caching (important: do this BEFORE any range handling)
const responseForCache = response.clone();
```
The code correctly creates a clone for KV caching before range handling, but later issues might still be occurring.

### 2. Multiple ResponseBuilder usages on the same Response object
Multiple instances of ResponseBuilder are created with the same Response object, which could lead to multiple attempts to consume the same Response body.

### 3. In `ResponseBuilder.build()` method (line 331-541)
The ResponseBuilder.build() method consumes the response body when creating a new Response, but if the original Response body was already consumed elsewhere, this would fail.

## Specific Fix Recommendations

1. **Ensure Single ResponseBuilder Instance**: Make sure only one ResponseBuilder instance is created for a single Response object.

2. **Fix Range Request Handling**: Ensure that after handling range requests, any new ResponseBuilder instance uses the modified Response, not the original one.

3. **Clone Before Body Consumption**: When multiple operations need to consume the Response body, always clone it first.

4. **Check in TransformVideoCommand**: The TransformVideoCommand class uses ResponseBuilder.build() multiple times, ensure those instances are properly managed.

5. **Prevent Duplicate Cloning**: Avoid cloning a Response more than necessary, especially if it's already been cloned.

6. **Double-check Execution Path**: Trace the full execution path in videoHandlerWithOrigins.ts, particularly at lines 700-747 where a single ResponseBuilder instance is created but might encounter issues if the Response body was already consumed.

7. **Investigate ResponseBuilder.build Method**: The error occurs at line 15274:18 in the compiled code, which corresponds to the ResponseBuilder.build method. Ensure this method properly handles already-consumed bodies.

8. **Modify Build Method**: Consider enhancing the ResponseBuilder.build method to defensively check if the body has been consumed before attempting to use it.
