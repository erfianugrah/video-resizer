# Codebase Analysis Findings

## Summary
After examining the main branch of the video-resizer project, I've identified several key insights about the actual codebase structure versus what might have been assumed or hallucinated in the `erfi/refactor-2` branch.

## Architecture Structure

### Core and Factory Directories
- **Finding**: The `/src/core` directory **does not exist** in the main branch.
- **Finding**: The `/src/factory` directory **does not exist** in the main branch.
- These directories appear to be part of the refactoring work in the `erfi/refactor-2` branch but are not present in the main codebase.

### Actual Project Structure
The main codebase has the following primary directories:
- `/src/config` - Configuration management
- `/src/domain` - Business logic and strategies
- `/src/errors` - Error definitions
- `/src/handlers` - Request handlers
- `/src/services` - Service implementations
- `/src/types` - Type definitions
- `/src/utils` - Utility functions

### Key Architectural Patterns
- The codebase follows a service-oriented architecture
- Configuration is managed through dedicated managers
- Error handling is centralized
- The main entry point (`index.ts`) handles initialization and request routing

## Implementation Details

### Configuration Management
The configuration system is implemented with:
- Environment-based configuration in `environmentConfig.ts`
- Dynamic loading from KV storage
- Manager classes for specific configuration domains (Cache, Debug, Logging, Video)

### Service Pattern
- Services are implemented without dependency injection
- Instead, they use singleton pattern accessed through static `getInstance()` methods
- Dynamic imports are used to avoid circular dependencies

### Error Handling
- Centralized error handling with specific error types
- Logging with context tracking
- Breadcrumb system for debugging

## Core Utilities
The codebase relies heavily on utility modules in the `/src/utils` directory:
- `cacheUtils.ts` - Cache handling utilities
- `clientHints.ts` - Client hints processing
- `deviceUtils.ts` - Device detection
- `requestContext.ts` - Request context management
- `responseBuilder.ts` - Response construction
- `transformationUtils.ts` - Video transformation utilities
- `urlTransformUtils.ts` - URL transformation utilities

## Notable Absences
The `main` branch does not have:
1. Dependency injection framework
2. Factory pattern implementations
3. Core interfaces and registry as separate modules
4. Clear separation of interfaces and implementations

## Recommendations for Refactoring
When continuing work on the `erfi/refactor-2` branch, consider:

1. Ensuring new architectural components (`/src/core`, `/src/factory`) are properly introduced with clear documentation
2. Maintaining backward compatibility with existing code patterns
3. Incrementally implementing dependency inversion rather than wholesale architecture changes
4. Keeping the same service responsibilities while improving their implementation
5. Ensuring proper error handling and logging throughout refactored components
