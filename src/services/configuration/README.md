# Configuration Service

This directory contains the implementation of the Configuration Service, which was refactored from a single monolithic file into smaller, more focused modules.

## Directory Structure

- `schemas.ts` - Configuration schemas and type definitions
- `caching.ts` - In-memory caching utilities for configuration
- `metrics.ts` - Performance metrics tracking for the service
- `loaders.ts` - KV loading and distribution of configuration
- `storage.ts` - Configuration storage operations
- `accessors.ts` - Methods to access specific configuration sections
- `validation.ts` - Configuration validation utilities
- `service.ts` - The main ConfigurationService class implementation
- `index.ts` - Re-exports all functionality to maintain backward compatibility

## Functionality

The Configuration Service is responsible for:

1. Loading configuration from KV storage
2. Validating configuration against schemas
3. Caching configuration in memory for performance
4. Distributing configuration to other services
5. Providing access to specific configuration sections
6. Tracking performance metrics for monitoring
7. Supporting non-blocking initialization for faster cold starts

The service uses a singleton pattern to ensure a single instance throughout the application.
